## FAQ
Q: How do i set a firing spot for a Vertex cannon?
A: Select the cannon and then tap the desired tile TWICE. Please note that selection does not stick to units - you have to select tiles/blocks. Cannon won't attack your own buildings, so feel free to select them - Vertex will act as protection.
