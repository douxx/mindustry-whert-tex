block.whert-tech-thermal-centrifuge.name = Thermal centrifuge
block.whert-tech-omnidirectional-bridge-conveyor.name = Omnidirectional bridge conveyor
block.whert-tech-omnidirectional-bridge-conduit.name = Omnidirectional bridge conduit
block.whert-tech-thermal-centrifuge.description = Adnvanced separator able to extract tiniest amounts of rare resources (such as thorium) from slag. Requires massive amounts of power to function.
block.whert-tech-omnidirectional-bridge-conveyor.description = Unlike regular bridge conveyors, this can link to others in any direction, not only axis aligned ones. Also it is a bit longer. Can [red]not[] be used in some case where regular one can be used, because it outputs items to all possible directions.
block.whert-tech-omnidirectional-bridge-conduit.description = Unlike regular bridge conduits, this can link to others in any direction, not only axis aligned ones. Also it is a bit longer. Can [red]not[] be used in some case where regular one can be used, because it outputs liquids to all possible directions.
