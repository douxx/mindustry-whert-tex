block.whert-tech-thermal-centrifuge.description = Adnvanced separator able to extract tiniest amounts of rare resources (such as thorium) from slag. Due to separation process complexity, sometimes outputs sand. Requires massive amounts of power to function.
block.whert-tech-omnidirectional-bridge-conveyor.description = Unlike regular bridge conveyors, this can link to others in any direction, not only axis aligned ones. Also it is a bit longer. Can [red]not[] be used in some case where regular one can be used, because it outputs items to all possible directions.
block.whert-tech-omnidirectional-bridge-conduit.description = Unlike regular bridge conduits, this can link to others in any direction, not only axis aligned ones. Also it is a bit longer. Can [red]not[] be used in some case where regular one can be used, because it outputs liquids to all possible directions.
block.whert-tech-discharge.description = A larger, more advanced version of Arc. Fires powerful arcs of electricity at enemies.
block.whert-tech-jetstream.description = Next generation of Wave. Shoots high-pressure streams of liquids at enemies.
